# Vue Demo App

Demo Project part of <a href="https://vue.ac" target="_blank">Vue Academy Workshop</a> in November 2019.

## Project setup

You need to restore the npm dependencies first:  
Run `npm install`

## Try it!

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server.  
The app is running on `http://localhost:8080/` and will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
